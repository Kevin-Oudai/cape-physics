# Units

## Introduction

Units are used to identify quantities. For example, 10 m means 10 metres. If the unit was not present then you would not understand that I am refering to a distance. In this section you learn
- to identify the base units
- to identify the derived units
- how algebra is used to determine the derived units
- what unit prefixes are
- how to interpret unit prefixes

## Base Units

The International System of Units (SI - Système International d'Unités) defines the base units as follows

| Base Quantity Name | Base Quantity Symbol | Base Unit Name | Base Unit Symbol |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| mass               | m                    | kilogram       | kg               |
| length             | l                    | metre          | m                |
| time               | t                    | second         | s                |
| temperature        | T                    | kelvin         | K                |
| current            | I                    | ampere         | A                |
| luminous intensity | $$I_v$$              | candela        | cd               |
| amount of substance| n                    | mole           | mol              |

## Derived Units

From the base units we can obtain the derived units by substituting the units in any formula that relates the quantity to other base quantities and treating the units like any other algebra term. For example, we can determine the units for area by using any area formula that you know. Consider the formula for the area of a rectangle

```
$$area of rectangle = length(m) \times width(m) = m^2$$
```

If you consider other formulas for area you will get the same result. You can try it yourself to verify it. This method of deriving units makes it easy to obtain a unit for any quantity that exists. However, there are some quantities that do not have units. Such quantities are called dimensionless quantities. An example of a dimensionless quantity is relative density.

## Unit Prefixes

Units follow a scalar value. For example, 10 m as stated before. However, sometimes the values are very small or very large. Consider the following values 300 000 000 ms^{-1} or 0.0000012566 N.A^{-2}. These values can be cumbersome to write  so you can use a prefix to reduce the number of values to be written. Consider the following prefixes, related symbols and the value the represent as a power of 10.

| SI Prefix | SI Symbol | Index Form |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| yotta     | Y         | 10^{24}    |
| zetta     | Z         | 10^{21}    |
| exa       | E         | 10^{18}    |
| peta      | P         | 10^{15}    |
| tera      | T         | 10^{12}    |
| giga      | G         | 10^{9}     |
| mega      | M         | 10^{6}     |
| kilo      | k         | 10^{3}     |
| hecto     | h         | 10^{2}     |
| deca      | da        | 10^{1}     |
|           |           | 10^{0}     |
| deci      | d         | 10^{-1}    |
| centi     | c         | 10^{-2}    |
| milli     | m         | 10^{-3}    |
| micro     | greek mu  | 10^{-6}    |
| nano      | n         | 10^{-9}    |
| pico      | p         | 10^{-12}   |
| femto     | f         | 10^{-15}   |
| atto      | a         | 10^{-18}   |
| zepto     | z         | 10^{-21}   |
| yocto     | y         | 10^{-24}   |

The values stated previously can be rewritten as 300 Mm.s^-1 (300 Megametres per second) and 1.26 uN.A^{-2} (the u will replace the greek letter mu - micro-newtons per square ampere).
